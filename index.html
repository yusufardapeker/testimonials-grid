						I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company
						I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

						“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and
						have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
						it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
						time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software
						Engineer at a VR startup. ”

					<p class="testimonial-content-description">
						“ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
						professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
						student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
						not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
						project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
						could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
						experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
						100% recommend! ”
